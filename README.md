## Contributor code of conduct

Our team is built on a foundation of learning, support, development, caffeine and a profound lack of sleep.

We recognise that we all have different strengths, and are better as a team than we are as individuals.

**Expected behaviours**
- There are no stupid questions, only stupid answers.
- We support each others learning.
- We will be *present* when working together as a team.
- We will contribute our time equally.
- We will help others succeed.
- Take feedback well, and grow from the opportunity to learn.

**Unacceptable behaviours**
- Unplanned absences without prior agreement.
- Lack of respect for others effort.
- Not meeting deadlines agreed by the team.
- git push --force

Forfeit for each lateness: 1 Twix or a flat white for each team member.

**Terminal behaviours**

- Not contributing any work towards reviews.
- Any behaviours that are threatening, offensive, or detrimental to other team members.

These will result in being removed from the team to preserve the remaining team members ability to product good work.
